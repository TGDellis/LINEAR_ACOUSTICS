# LINEAR_ACOUSTICS
C code (and python pre/post-process) that numerically solves the linearized acoustics 2D flow equations.  The buffer zone mthod is used for the boundary, and runge jutta 4th order for the integration. Monopole,DIpole and Quadrapole sources can be simulated in the center of the boundary.
